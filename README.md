BCIExplorer - Exploration of BCI data
=====================================

## Introduction
During my Master Thesis in Computer Science, i studied how to hierarchically cluster Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) data, for the purpose of exploring brain patterns at different levels of granularity. Data exploration is the basis to which data can be labeled and classified upon.

For this exploration, I created **BCIExplorer**; enabling visual representation of hierarchically clustered BCI data. Refer to the [Theory](#theory) section for theoretical details.
